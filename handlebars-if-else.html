Handlebars "If" block helper 
If you want to check for a specific object property before you insert a value, Handlebars provides you with the {{if}} helper block. 
The {{if}} helper is similar to the if conditional in JavaScript, but there is a difference in syntax:

-->

{{#if argument}}
  // Code to include if the provided argument is truthy 
{{/if}}

<!--The opening {{#if}} expression and a closing {{/if}} expression.-->

<!--

Handlebars "else" section
If that argument turns out to be falsy then you’ll just have a blank section in your HTML.
Instead, you can add a default line of code by creating an else section, using Handlebar’s {{else}} expression.

-->

{{#if argument}}
  // Code to include if the provided argument is truthy 
{{else}}
  // Code to include if the provided argument is falsy 
{{/if}}

<!--

Handlebars "Each" and "This"
Another helper that Handlebars offers is the {{each}} block which allows you to iterate through an array. 
Just like the {{if}} block, there is an opening {{#each}} expression and closing {{/each}} expression. 
Inside the {{each}} block, {{this}} acts as a placeholder for the element in the iteration.
Take a look at the example below:

-->

{{#each someArray}}
  <p>{{this}} is the current element!</p>
{{/each}}

<!-- 

This {{each}} block would be paired with an array like this in JavaScript:

const context = {
  someArray: ['First', 'Second', 'Third'] 
}

After compiling, the HTML will look like:

-->

<p>First is the current element!</p>
<p>Second is the current element!</p>
<p>Third is the current element!</p>

<!--
Using {{this}} also gives you access to the properties of the element being iterated over.

For instance, if you’re using the following array inside the context object:

const context = {
  someArray: [
    {shape: 'Triangle'},
    {shape: 'Circle'},
    {shape: 'Square'}
  ] 
}

-->

{{#each someArray}}
  <p>The current shape is: {{this.shape}}!</p>
{{/each}}

<!--

After going through the steps of compiling, the finished HTML will look like:

-->

<p>The current shape is: Triangle!</p>
<p>The current shape is: Circle!</p>
<p>The current shape is: Square!</p>

<!-- 

{{if}} and {{each}} can be used together.
This creates a conditional that needs to be met to define what will appear in the HTML
