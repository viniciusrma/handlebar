## üìë About

Welcome! 

This is a study about handlebars.

This is another repository where I keep a personal cheat sheet. 

In case you don't know me, i use to take notes about everything i study and save into a repository to make the later use easier.

Specifically here are notes on how to reuse html code with javascript using handlebars. 

I hope this is useful for you as it is for me.
